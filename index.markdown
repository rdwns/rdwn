   I sling code and manage Cloud Infrastructure at  <a class="orange-bg" href="https://www.thoucentric.com">Thoucentric</a>. When I'm not busy automating everything in sight or making sure our data is as secure as Fort Knox, you can find me deploying cutting edge ML models fit for production. I firmly believe that software should not only work like a charm, but also look like one so I like to add a dash of design to everything I do. I am always on the lookout for new ways to improve my craft, and this blog serves as my personal <a class="blue-bg" href="https://dev.to/jbranchaud/the-digital-garden-l10">"digital garden"</a> where I document my journey mostly as a reference for the future me.
