Well, here goes nothing. Setting up Jekyll was a breeze. I would highly recommend Jekyll for a blog. I have been dabbling in DevOps lately and my posts would mostly be about DevOps I guess. Or maybe I'll make some of my notes from Notion public, they're all over the place and don't cover any single technology as such but it might be a good idea.

Godspeed.
