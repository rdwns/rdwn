#### Thoucentric `Dec 20 - Present`

I’m the infrastructure wizard in the company, we use Azure but our infrastructure is setup in a cloud agnostic way which means little to no reliance on managed services and everything runs inside Docker containers and Kubernetes Clusters. 

I have built a couple of in-house tools, the most notable being **ThouSecure** which is basically a CLI tool that performs automated vulnerability assessments and applies necessary security patches and configurations whenever a new VM is deployed.

**Awards and Honours:**

In recognition of my efforts, I've been awarded a couple of shiny trophies during my time here at Thoucentric.

- **Making a Difference Award:** For contributions towards client outreach and business growth
- **Spirit Leader:** For instrumental contributions towards the development of Cloud BI and MLOps capabilities in the organisation
- **Atlas Award:** For organisational contributions beyond project delivery.
